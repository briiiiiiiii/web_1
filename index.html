    <h2>WEB</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>World Wide Web</strong> (<strong>WWW</strong>), commonly known as the <strong>Web</strong>, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet. The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server. <u>The World Wide Web is <i>not synonymous</i> with the <strong>Internet</strong></u>, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon the technologies of which the Web is built.
